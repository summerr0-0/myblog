Based in Seoul, Korea, I've been developing professionally for about 4 years.

I specialize in using Java and Kotlin with Spring Boot for backend development, and I also have experience with React for frontend tasks.

Currently, I'm working at PurpleI/O, where I handle a part of the backend development for Kolon Mall, a brand shopping platform.

I love diving deep into coding challenges and continuously learning new technologies.
